I for example, love it when people tell me how they feel about my mod(s), regardless of whether it be positive feedback or criticism.\n- If possible, try to contribute to your favorite mods. The simplest way could be for example helping translate your favorite mod(s) to your native language, helping mods become more accessible to a broader audience. Note that feedback and stuff like bug reports also count.\n- If possible, also try to offer incentives for developers to keep doing what they love. This could be something as simple as engagement, letting others know about your favorite mod(s), the things mentioned earlier, or it could even be something like helping fund your favorite mods (altho, not everyone is in a position where they could do something like this)."
