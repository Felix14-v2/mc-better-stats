//Note: Square brackets after a chunk refers to a chunk array; For example `IntLE-Chunk<...>[]`
//		To read a chunk, first read the IntLE that is prefixed before that indicates the chunk length in bytes
//      All subchunks start with `PBB-String` that indicates the chunk ID.
//		To read a `PBB-String`, first read the VarInt String length, and then the String bytes.

<"RIFF", IntLE-Chunk<"EXTENSION", IntLE-VERSION, IntLE-Chunk<...>[]>

//The "EXTENSION" always has to be uppercase and be 4 bytes in length
//The `IntLE-Chunk<...>` refers to one of the 5 possible chunk types: 'metadata', 'general', 'item', 'mob', 'player_badge'
//`PBB` refers to `PacketByteBuf` and `PBB-String` refers to a String written by a PacketByteBuf
